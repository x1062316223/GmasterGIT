Prowl the disease ridden streets in Vampyr - a darkly atmospheric Action/RPG from the studio behind "Remember Me" and "Life is Strange", developed using Unreal Engine 4.

Set in early 20th century Britain during a bout of the lethal Spanish ?u, the streets of London are crippled by disease, violence and fear. In a completely disorganized and ghostly city, those who are either fools, desperate, or unlucky enough to walk the streets lay prey to Britain’s most elusive predators: the Vampires.

Emerging from the chaos, a tormented ?gure awakes; as the player it is you who determines how to harness your new powers, by specializing in deadly, versatile RPG skill-trees that change the way you play.

Recently turned into a Vampire, an eminent doctor tries to understand his new af?iction. His quest of intuition, discoveries and struggles, will be ?lled with death and drama, while he attempts to stem the irrepressible thirst that constantly drives him to take human lives.

As you cling to what  remains of your humanity,  your decisions will ultimately shape the fate of your hero while searching for answers in the coughing, foggy aftermath of the Spanish Flu.
