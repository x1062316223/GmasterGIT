Created by Ubisoft Sofia, the studio that developed the original Assassin’s Creed Rogue, this remaster further enriches the franchise’s current-gen catalogue and will shine in 4K on Xbox One X (and run 1080p on Xbox One). Thanks to higher resolution, improved environment rendering, visual effects and textures, Assassin’s Creed Rogue Remastered  will offer an even more beautiful and immersive gaming experience that invites fans of the series and new players alike to discover or rediscover Shay’s adventures in 18th-century North America.
