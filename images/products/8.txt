Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity?'
Far beyond the limits of civilisation lies an island, a lawless place ruled by violence and human suffering, where your escape is through drugs or the muzzle of a gun. This is where you find yourself, stranded in a place that has forgotten right from wrong, a place where you must live by the principles of violence to survive.

Far Cry 3 Classic Edition brings the Rook Islands to current-gen consoles for the first time. Discover the island's bloody secrets and take the fight to the enemy; improvise and use your environment to your advantage; and outwit its roster of ruthless, deranged inhabitants to save your friends. Beware the beauty and mystery of this island of insanity. You'll need more than luck to escape alive.
